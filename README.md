- HTML5 (`<picture>`, `srcset`, `sizes`)
- CSS3 (Flexbox, CSS custom properties, shape-outside)

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` directly in a browser — no build step required.

## Improvements

- Removed `X-UA-Compatible` meta tag
- Fixed `<title>`: `Collections` → `Wall of Wonder — Responsive Images`
- Added `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to `target="_blank"` social links
- Removed invalid `align-items: space-between` from `nav ul`
